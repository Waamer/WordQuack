WordQuack is an educational game intended for students of grade 1-6 in which they further enhance their vocabulary and spelling. Wordquack is inspired by a famous game called
WordScapes and our goal for this game is to help encourage a generation of students that rely on too much spell checkers to build on their vocabulary through a fun learning 
environment. This game was created as a group project for the course CS2212: Introduction to Software Engineering.
